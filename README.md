Recipe Stack
====
A web app that allows the user to add their favourite recipes. A digital recipe book.

Why?
---
An idea I came up with to better understand the use of Constructor functions and further my understanding on DOM manipulation. Also, my girlfiend cooks a lot and likes writing the recipes down - so wanted to make something that she could use.

To-Do
----
- [x] Build easy to use form
- [x] Get user input into constructor - tested all working
- [x] Populate page with HTML elements filled with the user input/constructor info
- [ ] Loop through ingredients and list each on with bullet points
- [ ] Add full CSS to make it look tasty
- [ ] Add an edit/delete choice to the recipe cards
- [ ] Use JS to add an 'edit order' functionality - drag and drop style
- [ ] Allow upload of photo (of the meal) have it sit in the recipe card
- [ ] Eventually add to a SQL Database
